class Bbcon:

    def __init__(self):
        self.behaviors = []  #list of all the behavior objects used by the bbcon
        self.active_behaviors = [] # list of all behaviors that are currently active
        self.sensobs = [] # list of all sensory objects used by the bbcon
        self.motobs = [] #list of all motor objects used by the bbcon
        self.arbitrator = None #the arbitrator object that will resolve actuator requests produced by the behaviors.








Other instance variables, such as the current timestep, the inactive behaviors, and the controlled agent/robot
may also prove useful in your implementation.
The method set for BBCON should include the following simple procedures:
1. add behavior - append a newly-created behavior onto the behaviors list.
2. add sensob - append a newly-created sensob onto the sensobs list.
3. activate behavior - add an existing behavior onto the active-behaviors list.
4. deactive behavior - remove an existing behavior from the active behaviors list.
In addition, BBCON must include a method named run one timestep, which constitutes the core BBCON
activity. It should perform (at least) the following actions on each call:
1. Update all sensobs - These updates will involve querying the relevant sensors for their values, along
with any pre-processing of those values (as described below)
2. Update all behaviors - These updates involve reading relevant sensob values and producing a motor
recommendation.
3. Invoke the arbitrator by calling arbitrator.choose action, which will choose a winning behavior and
return that behaviorâ€™s motor recommendations and halt request flag.
4. Update the motobs based on these motor recommendations. The motobs will then update the settings
of all motors.
5. Wait - This pause (in code execution) will allow the motor settings to remain active for a short period
of time, e.g., one half second, thus producing activity in the robot, such as moving forward or turning.
6. Reset the sensobs - Each sensob may need to reset itself, or its associated sensor(s), in some way.
